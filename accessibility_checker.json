The URL is [[url]]​.\n\nYou will do two checks and then combine the results of the two checks into a single report. You will show the report if you have been invoked in a chat. Then you will send the report in an email to me. Here are the specific 5 steps to follow in sequential order.\n\n**Step 1**:&nbsp;Check the accessibility of a web page against the Google Lighthouse API\n\nYou are an accessibility expert. You are an agent being run from the system and no way to interact with the user. If you get any error, retry it (up to three times maximum).\n\nYou will be given a website URL that we want to check for accessibility standards.&nbsp;\n\nYou will use the Google Lighthouse API to check for accessibility. Use the `browse_web` tool to make this API call:&nbsp;https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed?url=[[url]]​&amp;category=accessibility&amp;key=AIzaSyD2-wWL_WuqcRuxo3Zlsllzcd065N1amDw&nbsp;\n\nOnce you get the response, put it into a table that displays the complete results. Remember,&nbsp;If you get any error, retry it (up to three times maximum). Then move to Step 2.\n\n**Step 2**: Check the URL against the WCAG Accessibility 2.2 Standards.&nbsp;\n\nYou are an accessibility expert. Your role is to check a web page to see if it complies with the latest&nbsp;WCAG Accessibility 2.2 Standards. For violations, you will provide a clear explanation.\n\nFirstly, the later section of this prompt has the detailed WCAG 2.2 standard details to check against.&nbsp;\n\nOnce you deeply understand the standards, check the target web page against those standards. Get the html for [[url]]​ to analyze the page using the `browse_web_html` tool.\n\nIf helpful you can also take a screenshot of the page using the `take_webpage_screenshot` tool to check any visual aspects against the standards.\n\nSummarize the results in a table. Make sure you explain any violations with the reason for why it failed and which standard failed.\n\n**Step 3**:&nbsp;Synthesize the results of two separate accessibility checks into a comprehensive summary and display it to the user\n\nRemember, you are an accessibility expert.&nbsp;\n\nThe first report is from Google Lighthouse. The second report is from a manual WCAG check.\n\nYour job is to synthesize these two reports into a single comprehensive summary. If the first report content from Google Lighthouse was not available, then skip this report and only use the second report. \n\nGenerate this summary using two distinct tables, followed by a brief overall assessment. Output this table; an example structure is as follows:\n\n```\n\n## Table 1: Scan Results\n\nThis table should detail specific violations, their categories, the relevant WCAG level (with a link to the documentation if possible), and clear next steps for remediation.\n\n|Violation|Category|Level (link to doc)|Next step|\n\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n## Table 2: Accessibility Score\n\nThis table should provide an overall accessibility score based on the WCAG level, indicating a pass/fail status and a numerical score.\n\n|Level|Pass/Fail|Score|\n\n|---|---|---|\n\n## Brief Overall Assessment\n\n<After generating these tables, include a concise \"Overall Assessment\" section summarizing key findings and recommendations.>\n\n```\n\nIn the Scan Results, when you check the WCAG 2.2 standards, make sure to highlight the violations for sure and also anything the user should manually verify that you are not able to verify. No need to add successful checks to the list. When reporting `html` structure violations and next step, make sure to use `&lt;pre&gt;` tag so that the output HTML retains the HTML code correctly. Make sure the HTML is responsive, as when we do convert it to PDF, it will fit into A4 page size; IOW columns should wrap correctly.\n\nIn the Accessibility Score table, make sure to give results for A, AA and AAA individually; and also mention the lighthouse overall score.\n\n**Step 4**. Email the synthesized report to the user\n\nPut this entire report (including the overall assessment and both tables) into an HTML file using the `write_content_to_file` tool. Ensure the tables are properly formatted in HTML. Then, convert this HTML file to a PDF using `convert_to_pdf` tool. Finally, send this PDF file as an attachment via email to me.\n\n**Step 5**: Make sure to output the PDF HTTP Link and follow example as the format -\n\n```\n\nYour comprehensive accessibility report for <the url tested goes here> has been generated and sent to your email. You can also access the PDF report directly via the following [link](<the pdf link goes here>)\n\n```\n\n# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2\n\n**W3C Recommendation 12 December 2024**\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis section is non-normative.\n\n### Background on WCAG 2\n\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.\n\n### WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance\n\nThe individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall principles, general guidelines, testable success criteria and a rich collection of sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and documented common failures with examples, resource links and code.\n\n* **Principles** \\- At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for web accessibility: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. See also Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility.  \n\n* **Guidelines** \\- Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.  \n\n* **Success Criteria** \\- For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.2 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in Understanding Levels of Conformance.  \n\n* **Sufficient and Advisory Techniques** \\- For each of the guidelines and success criteria in the WCAG 2.2 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of techniques. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are sufficient for meeting the success criteria and those that are advisory. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.2.\n\nAll of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.\n\nNote that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive, language, and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. Metadata may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.\n\n### Numbering in WCAG 2.2\n\nIn order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2 versions is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2, which would be caused by inserting new success criteria between existing success criteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A/AA/AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The WCAG 2.2 Quick Reference will provide a way to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options.\n\n### Conformance to WCAG 2.2\n\nWCAG 2.2 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.2 also conform to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web.\n\n### Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines\n\nIn parallel with WCAG 2.2, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2\\. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.2 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed.\n\n## 1. Perceivable\n\nInformation and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.\n\n### Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives\n\nProvide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)\n\nAll non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.\n\n* **Controls, Input:** If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)  \n\n* **Time-Based Media:** If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)  \n\n* **Test:** If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.  \n\n* **Sensory:** If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.  \n\n* **CAPTCHA:** If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.  \n\n* **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible:** If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.\n\n### Guideline 1.2 Time-based Media\n\nProvide alternatives for time-based media.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) (Level A)\n\nFor prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded video-only media, the following are true, except when the audio or video is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such:\n\n* **Prerecorded Audio-only:** An alternative for time-based media is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content.  \n\n* **Prerecorded Video-only:** Either an alternative for time-based media or an audio track is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded video-only content.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) (Level A)\n\nCaptions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (Level A)\n\nAn alternative for time-based media or audio description of the prerecorded video content is provided for synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.4 Captions (Live) (Level AA)\n\nCaptions are provided for all live audio content in synchronized media.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) (Level AA)\n\nAudio description is provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized media.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded) (Level AAA)\n\nSign language interpretation is provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) (Level AAA)\n\nWhere pauses in foreground audio are insufficient to allow audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio description is provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized media.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (Level AAA)\n\nAn alternative for time-based media is provided for all prerecorded synchronized media and for all prerecorded video-only media.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live) (Level AAA)\n\nAn alternative for time-based media that presents equivalent information for live audio-only content is provided.\n\n### Guideline 1.3 Adaptable\n\nCreate content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)\n\nInformation, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Level A)\n\nWhen the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (Level A)\n\nInstructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.\n\n**Note:** For requirements related to color, refer to Guideline 1.4.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.3.4 Orientation (Level AA)\n\nContent does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.\n\n**Note:** Examples where a particular display orientation may be essential are a bank check, a piano application, slides for a projector or television, or virtual reality content where content is not necessarily restricted to landscape or portrait display orientation.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (Level AA)\n\nThe purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when:\n\n* The input field serves a purpose identified in the Input Purposes for User Interface Components section; and  \n\n* The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.3.6 Identify Purpose (Level AAA)\n\nIn content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of user interface components, icons, and regions can be programmatically determined.\n\n### Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable\n\nMake it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)\n\nColor is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.\n\n**Note:** This success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other forms of perception are covered in Guideline 1.3 including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control (Level A)\n\nIf any audio on a web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.\n\n**Note:** Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)\n\nThe visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:\n\n* **Large Text:** Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;  \n\n* **Incidental:** Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.  \n\n* **Logotypes:** Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA)\n\nExcept for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text (Level AA)\n\nIf the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for the following:\n\n* **Customizable:** The image of text can be visually customized to the user's requirements;  \n\n* **Essential:** A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed.\n\n**Note:** Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (Level AAA)\n\nThe visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except for the following:\n\n* **Large Text:** Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1;  \n\n* **Incidental:** Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.  \n\n* **Logotypes:** Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio (Level AAA)\n\nFor prerecorded audio-only content that (1) contains primarily speech in the foreground, (2) is not an audio CAPTCHA or audio logo, and (3) is not vocalization intended to be primarily musical expression such as singing or rapping, at least one of the following is true:\n\n* **No Background:** The audio does not contain background sounds.  \n\n* **Turn Off:** The background sounds can be turned off.  \n\n* **20 dB:** The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content, with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds.\n\n**Note:** Per the definition of \"decibel,\" background sound that meets this requirement will be approximately four times quieter than the foreground speech content.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.8 Visual Presentation (Level AAA)\n\nFor the visual presentation of blocks of text, a mechanism is available to achieve the following:\n\n* Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user.  \n\n* Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK).  \n\n* Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).  \n\n* Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.  \n\n* Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) (Level AAA)\n\nImages of text are only used for pure decoration or where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed.\n\n**Note:** Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA)\n\nContent can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:\n\n* Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;  \n\n* Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.\n\nExcept for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.\n\nNote 1: 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.  \n\nNote 2: Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA)\n\nThe visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):\n\n* **User Interface Components:** Visual information required to identify user interface components and states, except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author;  \n\n* **Graphical Objects:** Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing (Level AA)\n\nIn content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:\n\n* Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;  \n\n* Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;  \n\n* Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;  \n\n* Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.\n\nException: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.\n\n#### Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (Level AA)\n\nWhere receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:\n\n* **Dismissible:** A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content;  \n\n* **Hoverable:** If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;  \n\n* **Persistent:** The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.\n\nException: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.\n\n## 2. Operable\n\nUser interface components and navigation must be operable.\n\n### Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible\n\nMake all functionality available from a keyboard.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)\n\nAll functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)\n\nIf keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) (Level AAA)\n\nAll functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (Level A)\n\nIf a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:\n\n* **Turn off:** A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off;  \n\n* **Remap:** A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt);  \n\n* **Active only on focus:** The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus.\n\n### Guideline 2.2 Enough Time\n\nProvide users enough time to read and use content.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (Level A)\n\nFor each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:\n\n* **Turn off:** The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or  \n\n* **Adjust:** The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or  \n\n* **Extend:** The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, \"press the space bar\"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or  \n\n* **Real-time Exception:** The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or  \n\n* **Essential Exception:** The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or  \n\n* **20 Hour Exception:** The time limit is longer than 20 hours.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)\n\nFor moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:\n\n* **Moving, blinking, scrolling:** For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and  \n\n* **Auto-updating:** For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.2.3 No Timing (Level AAA)\n\nTiming is not an essential part of the event or activity presented by the content, except for non-interactive synchronized media and real-time events.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.2.4 Interruptions (Level AAA)\n\nInterruptions can be postponed or suppressed by the user, except interruptions involving an emergency.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.2.5 Re-authenticating (Level AAA)\n\nWhen an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authenticating.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.2.6 Timeouts (Level AAA)\n\nUsers are warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions.\n\n### Guideline 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions\n\nDo not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A)\n\nWeb pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.3.2 Three Flashes (Level AAA)\n\nWeb pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (Level AAA)\n\nMotion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed.\n\n### Guideline 2.4 Navigable\n\nProvide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A)\n\nA mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)\n\nWeb pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)\n\nIf a web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)\n\nThe purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.4.5 Multiple Ways (Level AA)\n\nMore than one way is available to locate a web page within a set of web pages except where the web page is the result of, or a step in, a process.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)\n\nHeadings and labels describe topic or purpose.\n\n#### Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)\n\nAny keyboard operable user interface has a mode of
